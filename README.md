Plays a fixed URL (Adhan) on your Google Home speakers.

# Motivation
Google Home speakers do not support scheduled events, for example if i want a fixed file to be played at scheduled time intervals, it is not supported.

This script gets around the shortcoming, by moving the scheduling part to a computer. You can run it as a scheduled job on an always ON computer.
